📈 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure across different media platforms using Machine Learning techniques in Python.

The objective is to help businesses optimize advertising budgets by identifying which channels contribute most effectively to sales growth.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains advertising spend in:

TV

Radio

Newspaper

Target Variable:

Sales

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration

Checked dataset structure and summary statistics

Analyzed feature relationships using correlation matrix

Visualized feature impact on sales

2️⃣ Data Preparation

Defined independent variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper)

Defined target variable (Sales)

Split dataset into training and testing sets (80-20)

3️⃣ Model Building

Implemented:

Linear Regression Model

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Used the following metrics:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📊 Results

Achieved approximately 85–90% R² score

TV and Radio advertising strongly influenced sales

Newspaper had minimal impact compared to other channels

📌 Key Learnings

Importance of feature correlation analysis

Understanding regression coefficients for business insights

Translating model outputs into advertising optimization strategies

Evaluating regression performance using multiple metrics

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement Ridge and Lasso Regression

Perform Cross-Validation

Hyperparameter Tuning

Deploy model using Streamlit

Add feature engineering and interaction terms
